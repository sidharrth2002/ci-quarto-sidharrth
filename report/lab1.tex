\section{Lab 1}

\subsection{Solution}

Lab 1 concerned the combinatorial optimisation of the set cover problem, which is NP-hard. The problem is to find a minimum set of subsets of a given set of subsets such that all elements of the given set are covered. Since a solution cannot be found in polynomail time, any implemented solution is guaranteed to be suboptimal. For this lab, the problem is tackled through a collection of search algorithms:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Naive Greedy
  \item Greedy with a better cost function
  \item A* Traversal Using a Priority Queue
  \item A* Traversal Using a Fully Connected Graph
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Naive Greedy}

\begin{mintedbox}{python}
  def naive_greedy(N):
    goal = set(range(N))
    covered = set()
    solution = list()
    all_lists = sorted(problem(N, seed=42), key=lambda l: len(l))
    while goal != covered:
        x = all_lists.pop(0)
        if not set(x) < covered:
            solution.append(x)
            covered |= set(x)

    print(
        f"Naive greedy solution for N={N}: w={sum(len(_) for _ in solution)} (bloat={(sum(len(_) for _ in solution)-N)/N*100:.0f}%)"
    )
\end{mintedbox}

The greedy algorithm essentially traverses through a sorted list of subsets and keeps adding the subset to the solution set if it covers any new elements. The algorithm is very naive as it does not take into account the number of new elements.

\subsubsection{Greedy with basic heuristic approximation}

This version of the greedy algorithm takes the subset with the lowest heuristic $f$ where $S_e$ is the expected solution (containing all the unique elements) and $n_i$ is the current subset:

\begin{equation*}
  f_i = 1 / |n_i - S_e|
\end{equation*}

In real-life scenarios, the cost depends on the relative price of visiting a node/choosing an option. Since we consider all options to be arbitrarily priced, we use a constant cost of 1.

\begin{mintedbox}{python}

def set_covering_problem_greedy(N, subsets, costs):
  cost = 0
  visited_nodes = 0
  already_discovered = set()
  final_solution = []
  expected_solution = set(list(itertools.chain(*subsets)))
  covered = set()
  while covered != expected_solution:
      subset = min(subsets, key=lambda s: costs[subsets.index(s)] / (len(set(s)-covered) + 1))
      final_solution.append(subset)
      cost += costs[subsets.index(subset)]
      visited_nodes = visited_nodes+1
      covered |= set(subset)
  print("NUMBER OF VISITED NODES: ", visited_nodes)
  print("w: ", sum(len(_) for _ in final_solution))
  print(
      f"Naive greedy solution for N={N}: w={sum(len(_) for _ in final_solution)} (bloat={(sum(len(_) for _ in final_solution)-N)/N*100:.0f}%)"
  )
  print(
      f"My solution for N={N}: w={sum(len(_) for _ in final_solution)} (bloat={(sum(len(_) for _ in final_solution)-N)/N*100:.0f}%)"
  )
  return final_solution, cost

  for n in [5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000]:
    subsets = problem(n, seed=SEED)
    set_covering_problem_greedy(n, subsets, [1]*len(subsets))
\end{mintedbox}

\subsubsection{A* Search Using a Priority Queue}

The A* algorithm requires a monotonic heuristic function that symbolises the remaining distance between the current state and the goal state. In the case of the set cover problem, the heuristic function is the number of elements that are not covered by the current solution set, such that finding all unique elements symbolises reaching the goal state. The algorithm is implemented using a priority queue.

The implemented algorithm can be surmised as pseudocode below:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Add the start node to the priority queue
  \item While the state is not None, cycle through the subsets and compute the cost of adding this subset to the final list.
  \item If the cost has not been stored yet and the the new state is not in the queue, update the parent of each state. If travelling in this route produces a cheaper cost, update the cost of the node and its parent.
  \item Finally, compute the path we travelled through.
\end{enumerate}

              unit_cost = lambda subset: 1 if constant_cost else len(subset)
          )
\end{mintedbox}

The unit cost during search can either be set to a constant of 1 or the length of chosen subsets. The latter is employed as it helps the algorithm focus on finding all the elements with minimal overhead (redundant elements).

\subsubsection{A* Search with Fully Connected Graph (Failed Idea)}

An initial idea I had was to build a fully connected graph where each subset is in it's own node, and run an A* star search to traverse it and find a shortest path. For several logical and overhead reasons, this idea produced poor results and large bloats for big $N$s.

Given A = $[2, 4, 5]$, B = $[2, 3, 1]$ and C = $[1, 2]$,

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/astar.png}
\caption{Fully connected graph}
\label{fig:fully_connected_graph}
\end{figure}

The heuristic function is slightly different:

\begin{equation*}
h_i = len(s_i) - len(s_i \cap S_e)
\end{equation*}

where $s_i$ is the current subset and $S_e$ is the expected solution. It takes into account both the length of the new subset (to minimise final weight) and the number of undiscovered elements that it can contribute.

We can also immediately return a very large heuristic value such as 100 in the case of duplicating elements in the subset or in any situation where we want a certain node to be immediately skipped.

  REVIEW BY DIEGO GASCO (DIEGOMANGASCO)
SET COVERING (GREEDY):
I appreciated a lot the comparison between the professor's Naive greedy approach and your greedy approach!
The idea to implement a sort of priority function to choose the best set to add to the solution is nice (a kind of cherry picking).
I think you decided to take the set with lowest "f" because you want to keep low the total weight as you can.
What if you merge this idea with the number of new elements that the new set can bring to your solution?
You can try to find a sort of trade-off between having a new small set and having a new useful one!

SET COVERING (A* TRAVERSAL USING PRIORITY QUEUE):
In my implementation I basically used the same approach in developing my A* algorithm!
Like you, I decided to implement my heuristics as the number of undiscovered elements, and I took as cost, the length of the new set added in the solution.
I also noticed that, with cost sets as unit and not as the length of the new set, the process is much faster, but the solution that we reached is not optimal, so I decided to keep the length as cost.

The only small difference with my implementation is the use of the data structures.
To don't have to deal with list manipulation, I preferred to focused my structures in a more set-oriented way.
But never mind, these are just personal preferences!

SET COVERING (A* TRAVERSAL USING A FULLY CONNECTED GRAPH)
Unfortunately I couldn't try this implementation of A*, because I didn't understand the data structure "adjacency list" and there isn't a block that starts this piece of code like for the previous solutions
Reading your explanation about the algorithm idea, I can say that this approach can be useful with a solution space that is not huge, but can become computationally expansive with large N (due to the connections you might have to manage).
But anyway with small/medium N it can be helpful in reducing the time of the classical A*.

The code is written in a clear way and it's easy to understand. The code style is clear and the code is well organized in classes.
The fact that you tried to implement a sort of priority function to choose the best set to add to the solution is nice and smart.
Also you decided to implement your heuristics as the number of elements that have not been found yet, which is also a great idea.
My only question is that , what is the best way to estimate the weight, considering the new items?

Hi Sid,

here is my review:

The algorithm you tried as an augmented greedy solution is finding good solutions for small Ns, e.g. 29 for N=20 which is close to the exact solution. (you forgot to put N=20 in the solutions as well, it's good to add it as you are using this as your baseline). The function which it uses for cost is actually a kind of heuristic used in a greedy context. It is an interesting use case. for large Ns, It does not improve the solution, although meaningfully reduces the number of visited nodes. It's a kind of behaviour we observe when using heuristics in other search algorithms as well.

for A* search, your code is pretty clean and organised  specially implementing in a class which makes it reusable. the heuristic is reasonable and simple. comparing length as cost and unit cost is useful to see the difference. My experience was that not using cost and not keeping parents did not made much difference in this specific problem and it makes code much smaller and faster.

The fact that you used the itertools methods has made your code cleaner and more elegant. It is better to implement loops, e.g. in are\_we\_done() using comprehension, using inner loops in separate line will affect the speed significantly.

Using a fully connected graph is interesting experiment, I will follow.
