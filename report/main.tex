\section{Introduction}

\large

I had a great time taking this course and have learnt a lot about problem solving, game theory, genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning. Above all, I not only learnt from professors, but also from peers that are a lot older than me, and peer reviews really helped. I am grateful to have received a total of 9 detailed peer reviews over the semester.

In labs, I have tried to exceed the set requirements, often
experimenting with strategies I read in papers/found online and explaining them thoroughly in my lab READMEs.

This report details my activities throughout the semester, and is a testament to the work done over this course and everything new I have learnt.

\section{Conclusion and Final Considerations}

While working on the final project, I understood that complex algorithms do not necessarily outperform their simpler counterparts. I had spent a lot of time working on the Deep Q Network, and it didn't perform as well as expected. Despite hours of training, when the search space is too large, the algorithm takes an unreasonable amount of time to converge.

The proposed algorithm at the end of this project is a hybrid agent that leverages the strengths of random, hardcoded and RL (QL-MCTS) play. While it's performance (84\%-85\%) does not exceed the performance of a hardcoded player (+/= 90\%), I find it to be an interesting approach with potential for growth.

In spite of implementing several board symmetries based on the theory behind Quarto, I could not implement piece symmetries or board canonisation, which I'm sure would have reduced the search space.
