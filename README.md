Combining Q-learning with Monte Carlo Search Tree (MCTS) is a popular approach in reinforcement learning, known as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with Q-Learning (MCTS-QL). This approach uses Q-learning to estimate the value of actions, and Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide the exploration of the action space.

The basic idea behind MCTS-QL is to use MCTS to identify promising actions, and then use Q-learning to update the Q-values of those actions. The process can be described as follows:

Use the Q-function to initialize the value of each state-action pair, Q(s, a) = 0.
Use MCTS to select the next action to take by selecting the action with the highest value. The action value is the sum of the Q-value and a confidence value, computed as follows:
Q'(s,a) = Q(s,a) + Cp _ sqrt(ln(N(s))/N(a,s))
where Cp is a constant, N(s) is the number of times the state s has been visited and N(a,s) is the number of times the action a has been taken from the state s.
Take the selected action and observe the resulting state and reward.
Use Q-learning to update the Q-value for the state-action pair that led to the new state using the following update rule:
Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α _ (r + γ \* max(Q(s', a')) - Q(s, a))
where s' is the new state, a' is the next action, r is the reward, γ is the discount factor and α is the learning rate.
Repeat the process for multiple episodes.
This approach can be beneficial as it allows the agent to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off. MCTS allows the agent to explore the action space by simulating different actions and their outcomes, while Q-learning allows the agent to exploit the knowledge gained from previous experiences by selecting actions with the highest expected value.

It's also worth to note that MCTS-QL is a hybrid approach and there are other ways to combine Q-Learning with MCTS, each with its own variations of the formulas, like Q-Learning with Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (UCT), or Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Tree (UCT-Q) which may use different formulas for the selection and update rules.

Deep Q-learning with Monte Carlo Search Tree (DQN-MCTS) is a combination of two powerful techniques for reinforcement learning: Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). DQN is a variant of Q-learning that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function, while MCTS is a tree-based search algorithm that uses simulations to estimate the value of different actions.

Here's a high-level overview of how DQN-MCTS works:

Use a neural network to approximate the Q-function, Q(s, a, θ), where s is the state, a is the action, and θ are the network's parameters. The network takes the state as input and produces a vector of Q-values, one for each action.
Use MCTS to select the next action to take by selecting the action with the highest value. The action value is the sum of the Q-value and a confidence value, computed as follows:
Q'(s,a) = Q(s,a, θ) + Cp _ sqrt(ln(N(s))/N(a,s))
where Cp is a constant, N(s) is the number of times the state s has been visited, and N(a,s) is the number of times the action a has been taken from the state s.
Take the selected action and observe the resulting state and reward.
Store the experience tuple (s, a, r, s') in a replay buffer.
Sample a batch of experiences from the replay buffer and use them to update the network's parameters θ by minimizing the loss function, L = (r + γ _ max(Q(s', a', θ)) - Q(s, a, θ))^2, where γ is the discount factor.
Repeat the process for multiple episodes.
This approach can be beneficial as it allows the agent to balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off. MCTS allows the agent to explore the action space by simulating different actions and their outcomes, while DQN allows the agent to exploit the knowledge gained from previous experiences by selecting actions with the highest expected value. Additionally, DQN allows the agent to generalize the learning to unseen states which can be beneficial in complex and high-dimensional environments.

It's also worth to note that DQN-MCTS is a hybrid approach and there are other ways to combine DQN with MCTS like AlphaGo Zero.
